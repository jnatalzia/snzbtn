<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>To provide an innovative new approach to teaching young people the basics of prgramming through the use of the Leap Motion Controller and multiple interactive feedback.</P>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>"Spark*" is an online learning platform aimed at teaching young people the fundamentals of programing via the use of the Leap Motion Controller </p>

<h2>Required Materials</h2>
<p>Leap Motion Controller, found here: <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leapmotion.com</a></p>

<h2>Setup and Use</h2>
<p>Clone this repository and run the "index.html" file in the bigfoot/ directory,
in your favorite web browser. A Leap motion is required to run the program, or else
the file will white screen with no errors.</p>

<h2>GamePlay Instructions</h2>
<p>When the game opens, you are presented with a play button that you hover over until the game starts.
   After the play button, a toolbox with a spotlight is displayed.  The user will then open thier toolbox and will be taken
   to the level select screen. Once the user hovers over the level one button, the user will then be taken to the first level.
   The main part of the game is to build a house that protects against a number of trials. To build thier house, the user will
   open thier toolbox loacted in the bottom of the screen. Inside of the toolbox, there are three material blocks that represent
   variables.  The user utilizes the same hover that they experienced previously, and selects which material goes into each
   variable.  Once the variables are set, the users drags them down into the build bar at the bottom of the screen to build
   thier house.  Each level of the house is build of the material that is selected to be placed into that position on the build bar.
   Once all of the variables are in the build bar, the user closes thier toolbox with a downward swipe, and runs the program with by
   hovering over the play button at the bottom right hand of the screen.</p>
